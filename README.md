    Oh baby, thing's are getting serious. Got my monster white at the ready. React seemed straightforward conceptually, but I've got a lot to learn in terms of implementation. At the very least, I totally understand the purpose of it. More or less. At least I'm motivated to learn it this time.

    So what's gonna make this unique? I'm not quite sure yet. The gist will be, an app that allows you to create a wicked looking resume to use in crypto bro/hype beast type circles, and then an option to convert that into what looks far more professional, and which may convince an actual employer of the usefulness of crypto bro type skills. Essentially you input some info and NFTs, and it generate both a very artistic hype beast resume and a regular professional one. Not even gonna guess how long it'll take, because I have a lot to learn about how react works.

    So the past few work days, I've been having a real hard time focusing properly. This may be because I'm struggling with learning React, but I think I'm actually struggling with react because I'm having a hard time focusing. Could be a few different factors, but I'm going to guess it relates to my horrid vaping habit. During my studies, I've been justifying it as a thing to do so that I'm able to study full time, which at this point sounds kinda backwards. I think it's been gradually making me more tired while studying, so I'm going to cut back a large amount, expecially while studying. Win-win.

    In news related to this project, despite my struggling, I am a good chunk of the way into the main functionality of the project. Pretty excited to get it working at a basic level and then add all the fun stuff. JS wise, I really only need a button that changes classes on all the elements, and then I can easily switch between crypto bro and profesh resumes. With all that in mind, I'll project being done with this by end of day tomorrow.

    Looking at the projects and lessons ahead, I definitely feel like I'm closing in on completing the JS section here. And I'm pumped.

    Cutting way back on the ol' vape seems to be working. My eye has been twitching like crazy, but I feel like I can see the code in four dimensions now. Coming up with relatively straightforward solutions to problems, and noticing how I might change things if I were to build this again. Also the basic functionality is actually done!

    Finishing up the basic profesh resume styling, and looked at other TOP projects for inspiration. it reminded me of how basic the functionality of my project is at the moment. I think I'll be better off leaving it a little more basic this time so that I can put the things I've learned into the next one.

    Wow, really struggling to just toggle between stylesheets here. Not sure why this feels so complicated right now.

    I think my system for switching styling is the most ghetto thing I have ever created. And I haven't even started the actual stylsheet update yet. Hopefully in time I will actually learn how to just switch stylesheets in react, but I spent over an hour getting nowhere. So I'll try it my way for this project.
