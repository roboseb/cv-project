    Oh baby, thing's are getting serious. Got my monster white at the ready. React seemed straightforward conceptually, but I've got a lot to learn in terms of implementation. At the very least, I totally understand the purpose of it. More or less. At least I'm motivated to learn it this time.

    So what's gonna make this unique? I'm not quite sure yet. The gist will be, an app that allows you to create a wicked looking resume to use in crypto bro/hype beast type circles, and then an option to convert that into what looks far more professional, and which may convince an actual employer of the usefulness of crypto bro type skills. Essentially you input some info and NFTs, and it generate both a very artistic hype beast resume and a regular professional one. Not even gonna guess how long it'll take, because I have a lot to learn about how react works.

June 13th, 2022

    So the past few work days, I've been having a real hard time focusing properly. This may be because I'm struggling with learning React, but I think I'm actually struggling with react because I'm having a hard time focusing. Could be a few different factors, but I'm going to guess it relates to my horrid vaping habit. During my studies, I've been justifying it as a thing to do so that I'm able to study full time, which at this point sounds kinda backwards. I think it's been gradually making me more tired while studying, so I'm going to cut back a large amount, expecially while studying. Win-win.

    In news related to this project, despite my struggling, I am a good chunk of the way into the main functionality of the project. Pretty excited to get it working at a basic level and then add all the fun stuff. JS wise, I really only need a button that changes classes on all the elements, and then I can easily switch between crypto bro and profesh resumes. With all that in mind, I'll project being done with this by end of day tomorrow.

    Looking at the projects and lessons ahead, I definitely feel like I'm closing in on completing the JS section here. And I'm pumped.

    Cutting way back on the ol' vape seems to be working. My eye has been twitching like crazy, but I feel like I can see the code in four dimensions now. Coming up with relatively straightforward solutions to problems, and noticing how I might change things if I were to build this again. Also the basic functionality is actually done!

    Finishing up the basic profesh resume styling, and looked at other TOP projects for inspiration. it reminded me of how basic the functionality of my project is at the moment. I think I'll be better off leaving it a little more basic this time so that I can put the things I've learned into the next one.

    Wow, really struggling to just toggle between stylesheets here. Not sure why this feels so complicated right now.

    I think my system for switching styling is the most ghetto thing I have ever created. And I haven't even started the actual stylsheet update yet. Hopefullutton should submit your form and display the value of your input fields in HTML elements. The edit button should add back (display) the input fields, with the previously displayed information as values. In those input fields, you should be able to edit and resubmit the content. Youâ€™re going to mak

    Yep, doing it my way at least got the job done. Now I have a button that switches styiling to a setup I think looks pretty cool. Looks like today will be the last day, meaning I'm one day over my estimate as usual, which is fine. Getting closer to sticking to timeframes. With this in particular, I am still learning react, and I think that's as good an excuse as any for the extra time taken.

    God damn I hate CSS when it's giving me shit. But today, I somehow was able to quickly learn to create GIFs in gimp which is easy as hell, and then implement the gif as a repeating pattern used as a background image of an element. It starts super small, so it just looks like a grid of tiny pixels flashing two different shades of red. When you hover over it, it zooms way in and you can see the little ape skulls animating open and shut. Looks dope as hell to me. Combined with the looping gif of Hypebeast Nezuko, the gifs can add a lot while not being tacky or distracting. 

    Man, almost two straight days spent just styling the crypto page. Looks absolutely baller now, with only some dingbats left to add. I actually cannot believe how happy I am with the experience section on the crypto page. It looks insane. The fonts and colours are nice, plus I added some border-lefts that are kinda dynamic based on the info you add. Then there are the skulls I mentioned before. And I wasn't sure how I wanted to do it, but I succesfully added a simple line representing a graph that draws itself on the skulls. Looked stupid looping back to the start, and it also had some other issues so I threw it into some online gif editor. With one line of css and a half dozen re-downloads later, it looks simple but fun. The online editor let me loop the gif back to the start, which looks real neat. The editor also gave me the length of the gif, which I was able to use with keyframes to have the graph invert vertically every playthrough, creating "profit"!

    These past logs have been getting pretty rambly, but fuck you it's my README and no one else will see this until I start getting rejected from job applications. The way the site looks and functions now is pretty close to the style I would likely use on my own personal site. Probably not in terms of colour and theming necessarily, but the layout and interactivity is definitely something I like.
