    Oh baby, thing's are getting serious. Got my monster white at the ready. React seemed straightforward conceptually, but I've got a lot to learn in terms of implementation. At the very least, I totally understand the purpose of it. More or less. At least I'm motivated to learn it this time.

    So what's gonna make this unique? I'm not quite sure yet. The gist will be, an app that allows you to create a wicked looking resume to use in crypto bro/hype beast type circles, and then an option to convert that into what looks far more professional, and which may convince an actual employer of the usefulness of crypto bro type skills. Essentially you input some info and NFTs, and it generate both a very artistic hype beast resume and a regular professional one. Not even gonna guess how long it'll take, because I have a lot to learn about how react works.
